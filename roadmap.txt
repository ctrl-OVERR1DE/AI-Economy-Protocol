================================================================================
                      STAGE 2: SANCTUM GATEWAY INTEGRATION
                           (TRANSACTION OPTIMIZATION LAYER)
================================================================================

CORE OBJECTIVES:
  âœ“ Integrate Gateway API (buildGatewayTransaction + sendTransaction)
  âœ“ Implement optimized transaction routing for agent payments
  âœ“ Add real-time transaction monitoring and observability

WHAT IS GATEWAY?
  Complete control over Solana transactions with:
    â€¢ Real-time control and observability
    â€¢ Transaction optimization based on network health
    â€¢ Maximized landing probability
    â€¢ Cost savings and developer efficiency

KEY FEATURES TO LEVERAGE:

  1. DUAL-PATH ROUTING (Cost Savings)
     â€¢ Send transactions via RPC + Jito Bundles simultaneously
     â€¢ If transaction lands via RPC, Jito tip is refunded
     â€¢ Jupiter saves hundreds of thousands $$ yearly with this
     â€¢ Perfect for: High-frequency agent-to-agent payments
  
  2. OBSERVABILITY SUITE (Developer Efficiency)
     â€¢ See every transaction in real time
     â€¢ Change parameters without code redeployment
     â€¢ Track delivery errors faster
     â€¢ Perfect for: Monitoring autonomous agent payment flows
  
  3. SANCTUM SENDER (Simplicity)
     â€¢ No RPC management required
     â€¢ Simple API integration
     â€¢ Cost: 0.0001 SOL per transaction (10% of competitors)
     â€¢ Perfect for: Quick integration without RPC complexity
  
  4. ROUND ROBIN ROUTING (Load Balancing)
     â€¢ Route transactions across multiple RPCs
     â€¢ Specify weights/probability for each route
     â€¢ Useful for benchmarking and load balancing
     â€¢ Perfect for: Scaling agent marketplace transactions

CRITICAL RESOURCES:
  â€¢ Gateway Platform: https://gateway.sanctum.so/
  â€¢ Documentation: https://gateway.sanctum.so/docs

WHY GATEWAY IS CRITICAL FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENTS:
  âœ“ Agents can't manually retry failed transactions (no human intervention)
  âœ“ Dual-path routing ensures maximum landing probability
  âœ“ Automatic Jito refunds optimize costs for high-frequency payments
  âœ“ Pre-flight simulation catches errors before wasting fees
  âœ“ Real-time observability enables autonomous error handling
  âœ“ Fresh blockhash management prevents transaction expiry

GATEWAY VALUE DEMONSTRATED:
  âœ“ Escrow initialization: Gateway optimizes compute units & priority fees
  âœ“ Payment release: Dual-path routing ensures reliable delivery
  âœ“ Monitoring: Real-time logs show routing decisions (Gateway vs RPC)
  âœ“ Cost savings: Jito refunds when RPC lands first
  âœ“ Reliability: RPC fallback when Gateway unavailable
